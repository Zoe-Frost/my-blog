            <div id="tuesday">
               <h4>Tuesday</h4>
               <p>Yesterday I listened to what our upcoming assignments are and settled back into work, today I started thinking about what problem I want to solve and did two brainstorming. So far I am just having a little problem with getting used to everything again.</p>

            <div id="wednesday">
               <h4>Wednesday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I did some brainstorming. Today I will be doing more ideation into what my problem will be, and at the moment I am having trouble thinking of a way I can specify my issue.</p>

            <div id="thursday" >
               <h4>Thursday</h4>
               <p>Yesterday I finished finalising my issue within the fashion industry, today I will be ideating who my audience will be and researching information about the current market. I had no blockers today. </p>
            </div>
            

            <div id="friday">
               <h4 >Friday</h4>
               <p>Yesterday I ideated my target audience and researched current solutions. Today I will be doing my type brief and since I am a bit behind I will be looking at more articles about the industry and looking into my target audience's impact on the industry. At the moment I am lacking a bit of motivation getting back into everything. </p>

        <h2 id="reflect" >Week 1 Reflection</h2>
        <p id="written" >This week I found that my ideation went pretty smoothly, however it did take me some time re-adjusting to working again. Because of this I felt that my motivation was slack and I didnt work as quickly or as well as I usually would. I need to learn to re-adjust to certain settings better, especially due to the fact I work at home, so I need to have a clear line between home, and working. I am currently setting up an area which feels a bit more like an office and I think this will help. From now on I need to have set times for working and separate study and personal things better, this will be easier next term as my working area will be set up. </p>

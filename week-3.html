            <div id="monday">
                <h4>Monday</h4>
                <p>Yesterday I did some more interviews and it went pretty smoothly. Today I will be arranging my insights and themes and then gathering all my info together on my other device for things like, empathy maps, and then creating personas. My blockers are that my current work pace is too slow and the reason being that I am currently sick. </p>
            </div>
            

            <div id="tuesday">
               <h4>Tuesday</h4>
               <p>Yesterday I arranged and sorted through my insight and themes and found my main insights. I didn't get too much into my empathy maps but that is what I will be doing today alongside creating my personas. No blockers today. </p> 
            </div>

            <div id="wednesday">
               <h4>Wednesday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I finished with my empathy maps and personas on my ipad as well as going into the current user journey. Today I will be ideating solutions based on my problem statement and doing the what ifs. No blockers. 
</p> 
            </div>
            

            <div id="thursday" >
               <h4>Thursday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I did my ideation of solutions and what ifs and created my one sentence pitch. Today I will be creating my user flows on my ipad and starting on my paper prototype. No blockers. </p>
            </div>
            

            <div id="friday">
               <h4 >Friday</h4>
               <p>Yesterday I finished my paper prototype and user flows. Today I will be testing my paper prototype on my target audience as well as starting to make my type poster. No blockers

        <h2 id="reflect" >Week 3 reflection</h2>
        <p id="written" >This week I felt quite behind as opposed to my peers as for a while I was confused about the order in which I was doing things. However, I did get more done this week once I had figured out the order in which I was doing things as opposed to my peers. I had a difficult time in creating my paper prototype as I didnt know which way I wanted to go with the layout so that it would stand out against competitors, this led me to lose time on contemplating this and I learnt that I just need to make a decision sometimes because it can be changed later on. </p>

        <h2 id="reflect" >Week 8-10 reflection</h2>
        <p id="written" >This week I was struggling a bit with some personal issues so my production was slowed. However, I was indeed confident when I came to my presentation. I was quite proud of the fact that my shipping method for the recycling was something that an everyday person could do and that my way of explaining it felt more simple than what it realistically is. I had some trouble with my git extension which stopped pushing my code back to the main server. This was a big blow for me and if I had not copied my coding file before fixing it, everything would have been lost. When I first fixed the issue everything disappeared and I got worried. Thankfully, only a page or two was actually deleted and did not go over with my copied version. While this certainly put me behind again, I was able to still submit a flow although it was not with a database. In future, I need to ask more questions and I also need to further my understanding of coding. This is a subject that I find extremely difficult and I think that by writing things out and their meanings I can come to understand it better. 
        Note: The week 8 reflections are also spread into the next two weeks as per my extension.  </p>

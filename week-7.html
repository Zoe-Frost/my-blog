                <h4>Monday</h4>
                <p>Yesterday I started thinking about how my type poster will be coded and the interaction it will have. Today I will be continuing to make my hi-fi. No blockers other than I restarted my hi-fi as I was unhappy with the images used. </p>

            <div id="tuesday">
               <h4>Tuesday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I started on my hi-fi prototype again. Today I will not be working due to personal reasons. No blockers.</p> 
            </div>

            <div id="wednesday">
               <h4>Wednesday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I was off study due to personal reasons. Today I will be continuing to make my hi-fi prototype. No blockers. </p>

            <div id="thursday" >
               <h4>Thursday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I finished my hi-fi prototype and started on the wireframes. Today I will be implementing that into a desktop version for my coding. No blockers. </p>

            <div id="friday">
               <h4 >Friday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I implemented my design into a desktop version for coding. Today I will be doing more coding on my type brief. I am unsure about how to get my code to do what I am wanting. </p>

        <h2 id="reflect" >Week 7 reflection</h2>
        <p id="written" >TThis week I found that I had slowly gotten more behind and realised I needed to pick up the pace a lot. This was hard for me due to needing to take time off but once I was back I found that I was able to get into more of a flow in my work. This was great because I was connecting things together and more focused than I had been. I didn't have too many issues this week other than the fact that I was having a hard time remembering certain coding inputs. This slowed me down as I had to go back and remind myself. I think that It would do me some good to physically write out what different inputs mean in a way that I can understand so that it is easier for me to remember them.  </p>

            <div id="monday">
                <h4>Monday</h4>
                <p>Yesterday I did my pitch presentation and it went reasonably well. Today I started on my logo and brand identity. The blocker I am having is an icon for Remaro and how that will look. </p>
            </div>
            

            <div id="tuesday">
               <h4>Tuesday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I finished sketching out all my logo ideas and chose a final option. Today I will be putting that logo sketch into Adobe and making it into a png. I will also be making a secondary logo for this like paper and notepads if it's ever needed. No blockers. </p> 
            </div>

            <div id="wednesday">
               <h4>Wednesday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I finalised my primary and secondary logos in black and white. Today I will be choosing my brand colours and refining them. No blockers. </p> 
            </div>
            

            <div id="thursday" >
               <h4>Thursday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I refined and finished the Remaro colour palette as well as started on my mood boards. Today I will be finishing my mood boards and creating a stylescape. No blockers. </p>
            </div>
            

            <div id="friday">
               <h4 >Friday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I finished making my stylescape and moodboards. Today I will be doing more of my type brief and adding the Remaro brand colours into the logo to finish them off. </p>
            </div>

        <h2 id="reflect" >Week 5 reflection</h2>
        <p id="written" >This week I found that my production level increased and I got more done which was great and I found that my branding was quite a good fit with the uplifting colours for my audience. While I did get there in the end, I had a lot of trouble with the colour palette as I was unsure of which colours were contrasting well and if I should be adding in more or less. This issue was mainly just my indecisiveness coming through. Next time I think I will opt to have less colours in my branding as then it will be kept more simple. </p>

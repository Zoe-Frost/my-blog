        <h2 id="reflect" >Week 1 reflection</h2>
        <p id="written" >This week I found that my ideation went pretty smoothly, however it did take me some time re-adjusting to working again. Because of this I felt that my motivation was slack and I didnt work as quickly or as well as I usually would. I need to learn to re-adjust to certain settings better, especially due to the fact I work at home, so I need to have a clear line between home, and working. I am currently setting up an area which feels a bit more like an office and I think this will help. From now on I need to have set times for working and separate study and personal things better, this will be easier next term as my working area will be set up. </p>

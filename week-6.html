               <h4>Tuesday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I started on my hi-fi prototype. Today I will be continuing to do that as well as making my WIP. No blockers other than being unsure about my hifi. </p> 
            </div>

            <div id="wednesday">
               <h4>Wednesday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I continued to make my hi-fi prototype. Today I had a break due to personal reasons. No blockers. </p>

            <div id="friday">
               <h4 >Friday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I continued to make my hi-fi, today I will be working on my type brief. I am having some trouble when it comes to how I will be coding my poster.  </p>

        <h2 id="reflect" >Week 6 reflection</h2>
        <p id="written" >This week was a very hard week for me. While the beginning started off well I ended up hearing some upsetting personal news which drastically slowed my production. What had gone well this week was that the start of my hi-fi was finally taking some shape. What went not so well this week was my production level. I had a hard time concentrating and this made it hard for me to work. In the future I think that I need to get better at grounding myself for work and continuing to work through things. </p>

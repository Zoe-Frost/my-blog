            <div id="monday">
                <h4>Monday</h4>
                <p>Yesterday I tested my paper prototype and typed in the insights I gained from that as well as changes that I could make. I also thought about what I need to consider when it comes to the shipping method and how it will work. Today I will be doing my lo-fi prototype and testing it with the wireframes. I am having a few blockers when it comes to changing the layout. </p>
            </div>
            

            <div id="tuesday">
               <h4>Tuesday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I started on my lo-fi prototype and thought about who I will be testing it with in my audience as well as booked in meetings with them to test it. Today I will be finishing my lo-fi prototype and testing it. No blockers.</p> 
            </div>

            <div id="wednesday">
               <h4>Wednesday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I finished my lo-fi prototype and tested it with my audience. I looked through the insight and wrote in the main ones and the changes I should make. Today I spent putting together my pitch presentation and practicing how I will pitch it. The blocker I had today was how I want my tone of voice to sound when presenting. </p> 
            </div>
            

            <div id="thursday" >
               <h4>Thursday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I put together my presentation and started on my design strategy. Today I will be finishing my design strategy as well as practicing to pitch tomorrow. No blockers.</p>
            </div>
            

            <div id="friday">
               <h4 >Friday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I finished my design strategy and practiced how I was going to pitch. Today I will be pitching my idea and presenting it to my peers. No blockers.  </p>

        <h2 id="reflect" >Week 4 reflection</h2>
        <p id="written" >This week I had a good time getting through my work. I found that my tests helped me to get a clearer idea of how I want my website to look and feel. I felt that I did reasonably well in my pitch presentation which I am happy with. For what didn't go so well, I feel that I need to become more decisive as well as being more confident in my ideas, when I am pitching I sound uncertain to the audience which makes them feel less confident about the idea regardless if it's good or not. In the future, I need to be proud of what I am doing and speak with certainty to sell the ideas as opposed to questioning it. </p>

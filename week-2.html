            <div id="monday">
                <h4>Monday</h4>
                <p>Yesterday I brainstormed ideas for the type brief. Today I will be finalising my problem statement and pinpointing the specific issue in the fast fashion industry more clearly. No blockers today. </p>
            </div>
            

            <div id="tuesday">
               <h4>Tuesday</h4>
               <p> Yesterday I finished pinpointing a specific problem and creating my problem statement, I also ideated new solutions that I could use in my brand. Today I will be finalising my ideas for interviews and starting on my interview plan. No blockers at the moment. </p> 
            </div>

            <div id="wednesday">
               <h4>Wednesday</h4>
               <p>Yesterday I finished ideation on some solutions and my problem statement. Today I will be finishing my interview plan. I am having a bit of trouble when it comes to what I should be asking about this topic because it's quite well known.</p> 
            </div>
            

            <div id="thursday" >
               <h4>Thursday</h4>
               <p>Yesterday I finished off my interview plan. Today I will be starting my interviews. The main blocker I am having is technical issues, I have been having to use my ipad due to my computer acting up. I also am having trouble deciding what ux experience to take my interviewers through. </p>
            </div>
            

            <div id="friday">
               <h4 >Friday</h4>
               <p>Yesterday I got started on my interviews. Today I will be starting my sketches for my poster in the type brief. Since my theme is nature, I am having trouble thinking about how I am going to express this in the poster. </p>
            </div>

        <h2 id="reflect" >Week 2 reflection</h2>
        <p id="written" >This week I got a good lot of things done and the start of my interviews went really well. My documentation on the other hand was much slower due to computer difficulties. I need to be taking more breaks so that I don't get stuck on certain ideas and instead flow better in my work process. For the next sprint I will be working in intervals of 30 minutes and then taking 5-10 minute breaks.
